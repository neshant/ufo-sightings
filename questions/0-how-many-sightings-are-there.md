# Question #0 - How Many UFO Sightings?

To make sure you're up to the task, NASA is starting you off with a simple one.
How many UFO sightings across the entire globe do we have in our dataset?

NASA kindly has provided the answer to this one just to make sure you've loaded the dataset correctly.
Write an endpoint to serve up this counter and confirm that you and NASA are on the same page with a count of `80332` sightings.

The HTTP service for this question should work in the following way:

```bash
â‡’  curl http://localhost:<port>/<route>?<optional-query-string>
{
  "count": 80332
}
```
