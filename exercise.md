# Exercise: UFO Sightings

Earth is under threat of invasion from a hostile alien race and you and your team are our last hope!
Alien ships are spreading around the globe to key locations in preparation for a strike.
All radio communications are jammed but from the scattered reports NASA has received, the
ships are positioning themselves at locations around the world they are familiar with. It seems these aliens have been
sending ships for many years to scout out key locations to strike.

Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to take a dataset of previous UFO sightings from around the world and provide meaningful intel to the governments top scientists.

Since worldwide communication is down, the NASA engineers are asking for a simple `RESTful` HTTP service listening on `localhost`
that services up `JSON` responses.
This service will be used to provide data that answers their immediate questions and will potentially be extended in the very near future
as the Battle for Earth continues.

Help us `Credited Hacker #2`, you're our only hope!

## Goals

1) Solve the four questions below using the [UFO Sightings dataset](ufo-sightings.csv).
2) Save the world!
3) Get cake.

## Technical Requirements/Limitations

* HTTP service with `RESTful` API that returns JSON
* Any programming language may be used, e.g. Java, Python, Ruby, Rust, Nim
  * **Note:** The on-site portion of our interview will consist of a live coding exercise to extend this problem set so be sure to pick a language you're comfortable with.
* Any web application server technology may be used, e.g. Django, Rails, Express.js
* Any module/dependency may be used if you think it is necessary to solve a problem
* HTTP requests should not take longer than `2000` milliseconds to complete

## Exercise Requirements/Limitations

* Create a `git` commit after solving each question. This should be a checkpoint of your code after each one.
* Once you finish all four questions, read and complete the steps in the the [Submission](submission.md) document.
* Email [gloria](mailto:gloria@apptentive.com) indicating that you have completed the exercise.

## Questions

* [Question #0 - How Many UFO sightings](questions/0-how-many-sightings-are-there.md)
* [Question #1 - How Advanced is the Fleet](questions/1-how-advanced-is-the-fleet.md)
* [Question #2 - Evacuation Priorities](questions/2-evacuation-priorities.md)
* [Question #3 - One if by Land](questions/3-one-if-by-land.md)
