# Solution: neshant

**Date:** 8th August 2019

## Summary

The solution leverages already available solutions built for the purpose.
 
 Tools and languages used -
 1) Kotlin 
 2) SpringBoot Framework for REST API
 3) Spring data JPA for CRUD Repository
 4) Gradle as a build tool
 5) Postgres for persistence
 6) Liquibase for table creation and data migration
 7) Docker for Postgres
 
The csv file is loaded automatically in Postgres as a one off task by Liquibase which takes couple of minutes on first start of application.

## Requirements

 - Java 8 
 - Gradle (included)

## Usage

1) Execute the following script present in solution folder

```./gradlew clean build``` 

2) Run the application

```java -server -jar ./build/libs/ufosighting.jar```

## Answers

For each answer, copy/paste the execution of a simple `curl` command against your HTTP service and with its output
and time execution.

#### Example

An example section for Question #1 could be imagined as:

---

1) How many different ships will be attacking?
```bash
â‡’  time curl http://localhost:5000/ufo/sightings/count
{
  "count": 80332
}
curl http://localhost:5000/ufo/sightings/count  0.01s user 0.01s system 14% cpu 0.120 total
```

---

1) How many sightings are there?

```bash
time curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/ufo-sightings/count' | jq .
